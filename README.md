## For visitors
BECO (Be Eco) is a technological tool that serves to link eco-friendly businesses with  environmentally conscious consumers. This benefits both users and establishments. Users will find a way to discover new stores and products that fit their diets and preferences without harming the environment, and these small companies will acquire online presence and will be offered data analytics describing the profile of their customers, the success of their promotions, among others.

## For the team:
we will try to keep it as a monorepo and work by branches

### Workflow

Create a new branch where `<new_branch>` is the `<issue_number>` + `-<issue_name>` , e.g. `1-define-repo-structure`:
```
git checkout -b <new_branch>
git push -u origin <new_branch>
```
Work on the branch and when you are finished just commit and push the changes.    
Then create a Pull Request (PR) and wait for its merging :)

The issue associated will be closed and the task on the kanban will automatically be marked as "completed".

(Alternatively you can do this through github GUI)


count lines of code:
```
git ls-files | xargs wc -l
```
