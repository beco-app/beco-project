# beco-project
main repo of the project, we will try to keep it as a monorepo and work by branches

## Workflow

Create a new branch where `<new_branch>` is `issue#` + the number of the issue, e.g. `issue#3`:
```
git checkout -b <new_branch>
git push -u origin <new_branch>
```
Work on the branch and when you are finished just commit and push the changes. Then create a Pull Request (PR) and wait for its merging :)

The issue associated will be closed and the task on the kanban will automatically be marked as "completed".
